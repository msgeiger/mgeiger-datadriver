mgeiger-datadriver

Inspired/taken from Marook's https://github.com/marook/db-fitnesse.

Added Calendar Date data fixture to fetch dates in the past or dates in the future based on the current Calendar date.
Transitioned original db-fitnesse package from FIT to SLIM.

Example of Date Fixture usage in Xebium test:
