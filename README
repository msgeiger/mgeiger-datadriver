mgeiger-datadriver

Inspired/taken from Marook's https://github.com/marook/db-fitnesse.

Added Calendar Date data fixture to fetch dates in the past or dates in the future based on the current Calendar date.
Transitioned original db-fitnesse package from FIT to SLIM.

Example of Date Fixture usage in Xebium test:

|import|
|com.mgeiger.datadriver|

!|Date Data Fixture                                             |
|increment month|show month?|show day?|minute divisible by five?|
|3              |$MONTH=    |$DAY=    |$MINUTE_ROUNDED_UP=      |
